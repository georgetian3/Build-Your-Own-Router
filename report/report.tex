\section{Environment}

New Ubuntu 16.04.7 VM on Hyper-V. The only dependencies that were installed were in \code{setup.sh}.

\section{Problems and Solutions}

A major problem I faced was the difficulty of determining the contents of the packets both sent from and received by the router. For the majority of the debugging process I simply printed the packets using the functions in \code{utils.h}. However, due to the large number of packets being transmitted, this method was rather unwieldy.
